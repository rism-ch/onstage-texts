## Description
The "Freunde Alter Musik Basel" association was founded in 1942 by Paul Sacher and his comrades-in-arms. The concert programs with the corresponding performers' names offer a cultural-historical overview of the development of the early music movement. The programs of the first 50 years of the FAMB were listed in print in 1992 (Gutmann 1992, pp. 234-352). The online publication of the original documents since its foundation appears as a contribution to the 75th anniversary of the association in 2017 and will be updated regularly. The publication is a collaboration between [RISM Switzerland](https://rism-ch.org) (Bern) and the [Association FAMB](http://www.famb.ch/).

## The sources
All concert programmes - general and individual programmes - are kept in the Association's archives (in the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis), usually together with the relevant administrative documents. Initially, the publication of the documents (general and individual programmes, without the pure text booklets) was planned to be ordered and digitized by the staff of RISM Switzerland at the National Library in Bern. The programmes of the last few years (since 2007) had already been digitally produced and therefore did not need to be scanned.

## Notes on use
The write-ups are taken from the programme booklets. Some pieces may have been assigned to other composers in the meantime. The names of the ensembles and performers have only been standardized within the collection, but not further researched. The names of composers, on the other hand, have been compared with the norm data in the RISM databases as far as possible.
