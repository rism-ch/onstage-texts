## Description

The Theater- und Musikliebhaber-Gesellschaft was founded in 1806. At the end of the 1920s, it merged with the Orchestergesellschaft der Stadt Luzern to form the Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft of Lucerne (today the Luzerner Sinfonieorchester). The concert programmes of the societies mentioned document the lively musical life of the city of Lucerne during one and a half centuries. In addition, the older programmes in particular are likely to be an important source for music-historical questions on the development of the general concert repertoire as well as on the history of programming and musical interpretation. With the founding of the Festival Orchestra in 1943 and the simultaneous launch of the International Music Festival Weeks, which took place regularly from that time on, a new era in Lucerne's musical life began to take shape.

### The sources

The recorded programme booklets come from various holdings within the special collections of the Central and University Library of Lucerne. They date from the period between 1807 and approx. 1940. The digitised sources are essentially located in the following three collections and have correspondingly different call numbers: 
- Allgemeine Musikgesellschaft (call number BRb.27.2)
- Gustav Arnold collection ([Ms.N.46:6.3](https://slsp-rzs.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/41SLSP_RZS/lim8q1/alma9914249263605505))

### Notes on use

The names of the composers were, as far as possible, matched with the norm data in the RISM database. The attributions are taken from the programme booklets. Some pieces may have been assigned to other composers in the meantime. The names of the ensembles and performers were standardised within OnStage, but not researched further.
