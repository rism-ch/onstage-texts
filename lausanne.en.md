### Description

The HEMU-CL collection brings together 856 programmes of the events organised by the Lausanne Conservatory from 1880 to 2012\. They come from four separate collections:

* HEMU-CL Library;
* HEMU-CL administrative archives;
* Claude-Pascal Perna Music collections ([documents donated by Mr. Perna to the HEMU-CL](http://opacbiblio.hemu-cl.ch/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl?q=claude-pascal+perna));
* Archives Cantonales Vaudoises ([Fonds PP 475: Conservatoire de Lausanne](http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=43974)).

Only the programmes belonging to the first three collections are physically available for consultation at the HEMU-CL.

It is clear that the programmes digitised here do not represent all of the HEMU-CL's events since its foundation, but rather those that have been preserved for various reasons: for conservation purposes, in the administrative archives, or as proofs before printing (e.g. the programme for the [1968 prize list ceremony](/source/CH_LAc_prg_palmares-0010)). There are two gaps in their chronological sequence, the first from 1900 to 1924 (with the exception of a single [recital given in 1921](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0062)) and the second from 1974 to 1983, not counting the nineteen years between the founding of the HEMU-CL in 1861 and the [first digitized programme](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0001).

#### The series

The _onstage_ database groups the documents in 10 series: auditions, exams, concerts, award ceremonies, competitions, courses, Thursday concerts, midday concerts, others.  

These series are not "exclusive", a program can indeed belong to several distinct series.

#### Auditions

There were 242 hearings from 1880 to 1985 on the public performance of HEMU-CL students. They contain a particularly large number of names of composers. Some of the pieces appearing in them are taken from methods of which we have lost trace but which it might be interesting to find again in order to study the evolution of past learning techniques (the first names of composers may sometimes be missing from the indexes for lack of additional information). A careful examination of this series would also make it possible to analyse trends in the choice of composers who were given to play according to the level of the pupils (upper or lower classes) over more than a century. The names of the teachers are also indexed. The programs of the auditions organized during Troyon's era keep a written record of his assessments of the students' performances, transcribed in the "Notes" section of the record (an example could be given with the programme of the audition of [22 December 1938](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0188), in which Troyon notes "not brilliant" next to the name of a student).

#### Exams

Relatively short series bringing together the programmes of four public events, one in 1971 and the others, associated with the "Midi-concerts" series, in the 2000s.

List of the "exams" series (links):

* [25 June 1971](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0228);
* [5 April 2000](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0038);
* [2 May 2001](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0074);
* [2 December 2009](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0255).

#### Concerts

The collection's most important series, beginning in 1921\. The concerts are generally organized and presented according to:

* one performer (e.g. Clara Haskil on [27 June 1930](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0089));
* a work (e.g., the _Winterreise_ of [20 December 1990](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0350));
* a theme often announced in the title (e.g., the concert seeking to highlight Satie's humorous and nostalgic spirit on [9 December 1993](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0579));
* a theme accompanied by a lecture (e.g. the lecture given on _Music and the Hand_ on [15 January 1987](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0145));
* an event-ceremony (commemorating the death of a [composer](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0072) or [former Conservatory professor](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0012), [inauguration of a new instrument](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0033));
* a cause ([support for the teachers' pension fund](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0247), "charity" evening, [concert to benefit the National Gift](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0241)).

Note the "Exchange Concerts" set up in 1933 at the instigation of the Teachers' Association: first organised between graduates of the HEMU-CL and those of the Ecole Normale de musique de Paris, this practice was then extended to the [Royal Conservatory of Brussels](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0104), then to the Conservatories of [Rouen](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0073), [Salzburg](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0053), [Liège](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0102), [Paris](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0750), [L’Aquila](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0052) and [Castelfranco Veneto](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0630). We can also note a [publicity concert](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0048) for a piano brand in 1995. The concerts serve as a showcase for the institution much more than mere student auditions, the series reflects the life of the HEMU-CL at the historical and political levels. The programmes provide a wealth of information about the composers and performers (biographies, tributes, visits and invitations), as well as the way in which the concerts are presented - this is also the case for the "Jeudis" and "Midis" series.

#### Competitions

Although competitions for students have been relatively numerous since 1924, the HEMU-CL collection only lists 6 programmes, most of which indicate the conditions for participation, the obligatory pieces and, sometimes, the amount of the prizes. The programmes mentioning the Committee prizes, the Jacques Ehrhart prizes, the Teachers' Association prizes and the HEMU-CL alumni prizes are absent from the HEMU-CL collection.

* [26 October 1997](/source/CH_LAc_prg_Competition-0017).

#### Award ceremonies

A series of programmes for the award ceremonies, introduced by Charles Troyon and intended to close the year. As time went by, the ceremony became more and more "official": in 1962 the management report was enriched by [the Chairman's address](/source/CH_LAc_prg_palmares-0001), then by [the Vice-Chairman of the Foundation Board](/source/CH_LAc_prg_palmares-0010) from 1968 onwards. The ceremony also includes the awarding of diplomas and prizes and 3 to 12 pieces of music. The HEMU-CL collection contains 14 programmes from 1926 to 1971.  

List of the "palmarès" series (links):

#### Conferences

There are 116 of them; the oldest in the collection dates from [1939](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0190). On various musicological subjects ([life of composers](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0309), [aesthetics of music](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0732), [analysis of musical works](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0530), [interpretive techniques](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0703), [considerations on contemporary music](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0156), [organology](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0169), [ethnomusicology](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0185)), they reflect the concerns and interests of each era. The content of the lectures is summarized in the title or in a short text on the back of the digitized programme (e.g., Round Table on the Apprehension of Atonal Music, [6 December 1990](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0342)). In the 1940s, there was a clear predominance of "lecture-auditions", in which the performer commented on the work he was playing (e.g., Denise Vidal comments on Beethoven's Op. 120, [18 February 1944](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0008)). The role of commentator can also be given to a second speaker. The numerous lectures that are part of the "Thursdays at the Conservatory" usually feature the speaker alone. Note also the series of lectures that take place over several days (sometimes in collaboration with other institutions or cultural associations, such as the University of Lausanne for the colloquium [Guy de Pourtalès](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0044) in 1994).

#### Courses

This series includes public interpretation courses and courses on historical subjects, similar to lectures over several days. Note the two public courses (now called "masterclasses") given by Alfred Cortot during the era of Alfred Pochon ([1949](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0043) and [1950](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0055)). Programmes contain sometimes the description of a particular course, or the announcement of a series of weekly courses given by a single teacher (e.g., [the sonata course](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons0182) given during the 1963-1964 academic year by Paul-André Gaillard).

#### Thursday concerts

Created in 1984 under the aegis of Jean-Jacques Rapin, the mission of the "Jeudis du Conservatoire" is to develop the intellectual and cultural counterpart of the institution. This ambitious project invites personalities from the world of music and gives the school's teachers and students a space to perform. The "Jeudis" are very often built around a specific subject, but can also take the form of a music recital (e.g., [5 December 1985](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0069)), a public lecture (e.g., [23 April 1987](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0173)), or a performance (e.g., [22 November 1990](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0333)). Topics range from music history (portraits of musicians are common, e.g., [Arthur Honegger](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0481)), to the [dialogue between the arts](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0682), [organology](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0402), the physical health of musicians (e.g., [back pain](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0422)) and many other music-related considerations. The programmes in this series are thus systematically linked to another series, concerts, lectures or other events. The "Thursdays" ended in 1998, at the same time as Rapin's direction. The collection includes a majority of the programmes. Although some are missing, it is possible to reconstruct the entire series by consulting the last page of the digitized programmes, announcing the following ones (e.g., the programme of [15 January 1987](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0145) and the following ones mention Rudolf Kelterborn's lecture of 25 February).

#### Midday concerts

A sort of extension by Olivier Cuendet of the "Jeudis du Conservatoire", the "Midi-concerts" feature musicians from the Conservatory and elsewhere. Unlike the "Jeudis", they only focus on concerts. The 192 programmes digitised here do not represent the entire series, which is still current and therefore continues to grow without being inserted in the _onstage_ database.

#### Others

This series includes programmes with features that go beyond the above-mentioned series, mainly poetry recitations (e.g., [Jacques Chessex](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0081)). The other programmes concern three shows (presented by the Section Professionnelle d'Art Dramatique or SPAD, which emerged from the Ecole Romande d'Art Dramatique in 1969: 21 November 1990](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0333), [9 December 1993](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0579), [7 November 1996](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0715)) and a [film projection](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0085).

#### Venues

Generally speaking, the programmes mention the place where the event they describe takes place. The same name ("Grande salle du Conservatoire" for example) may refer to different addresses depending on the period and the institution's moves.

The first auditions (1880s and 1890s) were held directly at the "Institut de Musique", which until 1908 was located in a building in Derrière-Bourg, after having already moved twice. The references "Avenue du Théâtre 4", "Théâtre de Lausanne" and "Casino-Théâtre" probably all refer to the same place, the Casino-Théâtre, which was inaugurated in 1871 and has since become the Théâtre municipal (also mentioned in later programmes) and then the Opéra de Lausanne. Clearly, the cramped nature of its premises forced the Conservatory to look for alternatives for its concerts.

The Conservatory moved in 1908 to Rue du Midi 6\. Auditions then generally took place in the "Grande salle du Conservatoire", but larger events were held in the "Grande salle de la Maison du Peuple". The Conservatoire expanded in 1942 with the acquisition of number 8 on the same street, although the concert hall still remained at the previous address.

The Conservatory finally moved to rue de la Grotte, in the former Galeries du Commerce in 1990, where it still remains, despite changes in the names of the halls in 2011 (the "Grande salle" thus becomes "Utopia 1").

The Casino de Montbenon is an occasional annex. Some concerts or events may take place in churches or other concert halls in the town. As for the exchange concerts, half of them take place in the partner conservatories.

#### Full-text search

The programmes are rich sources of information, not only musicological but also historical and aesthetic. Some have not been recorded in the index but still appear in the digitized document, such as the advertising on the back of the programmes (very common in the 1930s, e.g. [22 December 1932](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0108)), the price of seats (at [1.15 CHF](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0067), for example in 1952), the typography ([11 January 1936](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0151)) and the medium _(_[Percu'plast!c](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0066)in 2001_),_ or the way the information is presented (the title for example, which can be [pictorial](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0170) or [formal](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0120), [succinct](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0378) or [periphrastic](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0019)). Students who have participated in auditions are too numerous to have their names indexed unless they have given recitals. In the "Jeudis" series, the words of director [Jean-Jacques Rapin and of Sabine de Meuron](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0001) and then of [Fabienne Siegwart-Cornaz](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0342), successive presidents of the Association of Friends of the Lausanne Conservatory, are listed in only one programme, as they are repeated identically in the others.

#### Composers named in programmes

J. S. Bach is without a doubt the most frequently performed composer in the institution; his name appears on about 30% of the programmes listed. He is thus ahead of Beethoven (29%), Mozart (24%), Chopin (22%), Schumann (19%), Schubert (15%) and Brahms (13%). This head of the list can easily be linked to the clear predominance of piano lessons over those of other instruments at the Conservatory.

The preference for composers from the classical and romantic periods can also be explained by the extent of the time interval under consideration: modern and contemporary composers are less represented because they were born during the development of the Lausanne Conservatory (they cannot therefore appear in the first programmes); similarly, interest in so-called "early" music (apart from that of Bach) took off during the 20th century.

Thus, Rameau appeared for the first time in a piano recital in [1921](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0062), alongside Rachmaninov, Couperin and D. Scarlatti, whereas by that time Bach had already been played 14 times and Mozart 20 times. The first program mentioning Vivaldi dates from [1926](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0066). It must be said that Brahms was not much played at that time either; it was only in the 1950s and 1960s that he began to appear in many programs (58 entries between 1950 and 1969 compared to only 2 between 1880 and 1899).

Here are two diagrams showing the evolution of trends in programming (percentage of each composer's entries in the total number of programmes per decade):

<div align="center">

<table border="0" cellspacing="50px">

<td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rism-ch/onstage-texts/master/images/image002.png"/></td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

</div>

It can be seen that, while at the end of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century one composer still had a very marked predominance over the others, this tendency was eroded at the end of the century, when the percentages were much lower. This could be explained by the increase in the number of lectures and a greater diversity in the programming and the instruments played.

This study is only a sketch of the trends in the composers played: it would indeed be necessary to extend it to a greater number of programmes and, above all, to have greater regularity in the quantities per year in order to draw complete and detailed conclusions, all the more so since, in the case of the HEMU-CL collection, the predominance may be influenced by the personal preferences of the teachers.
