### Description

The HEMU-CL collection brings together 856 programmes of the events organised by the Lausanne Conservatory from 1880 to 2012\. They come from four separate funds:

* HEMU-CL Library;
* HEMU-CL administrative archives;
* Claude-Pascal Perna Music Fund ([documents donated by Mr. Perna to the HEMU-CL](http://opacbiblio.hemu-cl.ch/cgi-bin/koha/opac-search.pl?q=claude-pascal+perna));
* Archives Cantonales Vaudoises ([Fonds PP 475: Conservatoire de Lausanne](http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=43974)).

Only the programmes belonging to the first three fonds are physically available for consultation at the HEMU-CL.

It is clear that the programmes digitised here do not represent all of the HEMU-CL's events since its foundation, but rather those that have been preserved for various reasons: for conservation purposes, in the administrative archives, or as proofs before printing (e.g. the programme for the [1968 prize list ceremony](/source/CH_LAc_prg_palmares-0010)). There are two gaps in their chronological sequence, the first from 1900 to 1924 (with the exception of a single [recital given in 1921](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0062)) and the second from 1974 to 1983, not counting the nineteen years between the founding of the HEMU-CL in 1861 and the [first digitized program](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0001).

#### The series

The _onstage_ database groups the documents in 10 series: auditions, exams, concerts, prize list, competitions; courses; Thursday; noon-concerts; others.  

These series are not "exclusive", a program can indeed belong to several distinct series.

#### Auditions

There were 242 hearings from 1880 to 1985 on the public performance of HEMU -CL students. They contain a particularly large number of names of composers. Some of the pieces appearing in them are taken from methods of which we have lost trace but which it might be interesting to find again in order to study the evolution of past learning techniques (the first names of composers may sometimes be missing from the indexes for lack of additional information). A careful examination of this series would also make it possible to analyse trends in the choice of composers who were given to play according to the level of the pupils (upper or lower classes) over more than a century. The names of the teachers are also indexed. The programs of the auditions organized during Troyon's era keep a written record of his assessments of the students' performances, transcribed in the "Notes" section of the record (an example could be given with the program of the audition of [December 22, 1938](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0188), in which Troyon notes "Not brilliant" next to the name of a student).

#### Exams

Relatively short series bringing together the programmes of four public events, one in 1971 and the others, associated with the "Midi-concerts" series, in the 2000s.

List of the "exams" series (links) :

* [June 25, 1971](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0228) ;
* [April 5, 2000](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0038);
* May 2, 2001](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0074);
* December 2, 2009](/source/CH_LAc_prg_midi-concerts-0255).

#### Concerts

The fund's most important series, beginning in 1921\. The concerts are generally organized and presented according to :

* one performer (e.g. Clara Haskil on [June 27, 1930](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0089));
* a work (e.g., the _Winterreise_ of [December 20, 1990](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0350));
* a theme often announced in the title (e.g., the concert seeking to highlight Satie's humorous and nostalgic spirit on [December 9, 1993](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0579));
* a theme accompanied by a lecture (e.g. the lecture given on _Music and the Hand_ on [January 15, 1987](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0145));
* an event-ceremony (commemorating the death of a [composer](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0072) or [former Conservatory professor](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0012), [inauguration of a new instrument](/source/CH_LAc_prg_concerts-0033));
* a cause ([support for the teachers' pension fund](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0247), "charity" evening, [concert to benefit the National Gift](/source/CH_LAc_prg_dates-0241)).

Note the "Exchange Concerts" set up in 1933 at the instigation of the Teachers' Association: first organised between graduates of the HEMU -CL and those of the Ecole Normale de musique de Paris, this practice was then extended to the [Royal Conservatory of Brussels](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0104), then at the Conservatories of [Rouen](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0073), [Salzburg](/source/CH_LAc_prg_jeudis-0053), [Liège](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-0053), [Liège](/source/CH_LAc_prg_seasons-2010)
