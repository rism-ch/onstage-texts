#### Onstage allows:

* to search documents in full text or brose by index;
* to display the documents and metadata;
* to pin your documents;
* to export a permalink for each collection and for each document.

#### Search modes:

* "Search": searches for one or more words in all listed data; search for a string using "". The search is not case sensitive;
* A search can be restricted to words contained in a specific index ("composers", "performers" etc.).
* The displayed documents can be narrowed down using the date slider and/or by selecting a term from the various filters.
* "Browse": gives access to lists where the different indexes of the database are displayed. 

The results are displayed in chronological order.

Please note that some collections do not have a performer index. Try also with the full text search!
The performers index, if available, also contains the names of the conductors.
